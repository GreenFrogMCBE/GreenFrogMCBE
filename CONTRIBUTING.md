# Contributing rules

Before making a PR:

1. Run `npm run fomat` to format the project, if possible, if not our bot will do it
2. Please make docs for functions that you make
3. Make commit names like that: "[part of code that got changed (e.g API, Network, etc)]: [commit name]".
4. If you do not want for your commit to be added into the changelog add "[skip-changelog]" at the beggining the commit name
