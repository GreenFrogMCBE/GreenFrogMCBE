# Contributing rules

Contributing rules:

1. Run `npm run build` to build the project, if possible, if not the bot will do it
2. Please make docs for functions that you make
3. Make commit names like that: "[part of code that got changed (e.g API, Network, etc)]: [commit name]". Example: "Docs: Fixed typo", "API: Removed useless functions", "Chunks: Added new generators"
4. If you do not want for your commit to be added into the changelog add "[skip-changelog]" at the beggining the commit name
