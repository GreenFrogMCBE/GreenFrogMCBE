# Contributing rules

Contributing rules:

1. Don't make commits like "fkasjfkdsfhjsdfhsjdf"
2. Run `npm run build` to build the project, if possible, if not the bot will do it
3. Please make docs for functions that you make
4. Make commit names like that: "[commit theme]: [commit name]". Example: "Docs: Fixed typo", "API: Removed useless functions", "Chunks: Added new generators"
5. If you do not want for your commit to be added into the changelog add "[nochangelog]" at the beggining the commit name
